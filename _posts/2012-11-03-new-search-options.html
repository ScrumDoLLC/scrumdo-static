<h1>New Search Options</h1>
<p>Today, we released a new search syntax you can use to find your stories.  You can use this in the search box at the top of every page, or in the filter field from an iteration.  Click the "Search Options" link on search pages to bring up a dialog to help you build your search.
</p>
<p>Here are some quick examples to get you started:
</p>
<p>"#10" - Search for story #10
</p>
<p>"star wars" - All stories that contains the text "star wars"
</p>
<p>"assigned: mhughes" - All stories that are assigned to mhughes
</p>
<p>"tag: bug" - All stories that are tagged with the bug tag 
</p>
<p>"assigned: mhughes, assigned: bob, tag: bug, star wars" - All stories that are assigned to either mhughes or bob and have the bug tag, and contain the text "star wars"
</p>
<h3>Free Text</h3>
<p>Type text into the box to search for it anywhere within the story or the comments of that story.
</p>
<p>Example: "my search"
</p>
<h3>By number</h3>
<p>You can find a story by it's number by including the hash (#) symbol.  Search for multiple story numbers by separating them with commas.
</p>
