title: What is Scrumban & Why Should I Care?
---

The ScrumDo team has been hard at work preparing to release a new set of features and functionality to ScrumDo.  We've already introduced some basic Kanban features, and what we have in store will build upon this base.  

Existing users won't experience any major changes with our release -- unless they want to.  So we'd like to share a little more about how our tool supports the option to layer Kanban with Scrum, and why that might be important to you and your Scrum teams.


###Some quick background###

Respected “talking heads” in the software development community often seek to compare Scrum and Kanban.  Unfortunately, most of these comparisons are based on an incomplete understanding of both frameworks, leaving those on the receiving end with the distinct impression that employing either method represents a binary selection.  In reality, each predominately serves very different purposes.  Consequently, comparing the two is a bit like asking a racecar driver if the engine under the hood or the wheels on the ground is more important to being able to cross the finish line fastest.


###Scrumban - it isn’t what you think###

So if Scrum and Kanban are so different, what is this thing called Scrumban?   Some people claim it’s a methodology that combines some of the elements of Scrum with some of the elements of Kanban, resulting in a hybrid approach.  To be blunt, these people are wrong.

Scrumban is actually the application of all the elements of Kanban within an existing Scrum environment.  To truly appreciate what this means, it helps to review what each of these frameworks represents.

Scrum is first and foremost a project management methodology and process (though it also possesses some characteristics of a tool that can be used for provoking change and emergent behavior).  As a project management methodology, Scrum prescribes a set of roles working within a formalized, iterative process (product owners, scrum masters, release planning, sprint planning, iterations, retrospectives, and so forth).  As a change catalyst, it has traditionally utilized the concept of “commitment” as a control mechanism for helping to bring about desired modifications.

Scrum is extremely effective at optimizing work processes for small teams of 7-12 people. It isolates the team’s work inside time-boxed batches of development work called Sprints, and employs a variety of techniques to make these batches of work as predictable as possible (in order to meet the Sprint Commitment).  In doing these things, Scrum seeks to isolate the team from outside influences as much as possible.  It is definitively an agile methodology.

The Kanban Method, on the other hand, is neither a project management nor a software development methodology.  In fact, it doesn’t tell us how to do these things at all, and requires an existing process against which to be applied.  

Kanban is a proven and effective framework for catalyzing evolutionary change and enabling continuous improvement within teams and across organizations.  It enables individuals, teams and organizations to better understand how they work.  It employs a handful of mechanisms to simplify coordination across whole systems and to maximize resources across multiple teams.  Ambiguity is purposely built-in so the framework can be successfully applied in any context or way in which we do work -- Scrum or otherwise.

When Kanban is applied to Scrum, the resulting framework is called Scrumban.  Scrum tools don't have all the necessary features and metrics to manage the Kanban side of the house.  And Kanban tools don't have the necessary features and functionality to manage the Scrum side of the house.  We created ScrumDo for Scrum from the ground up so Scrum teams wouldn't have to make compromises.  We're evolving ScrumDo for Scrumban for the same reason.

Now here’s a really important concept to grasp, and something to bear in mind when you think about the challenge we face as a tool provider.  Even though two separate teams or organizations might both practice Scrum, adopting Scrumban in each will likely result in two very different environments.  How can this be?  Because Scrum becomes a shared, pragmatically dynamic, scientifically improving process when Kanban is applied to it.  

Fortunately, teams and organizations practicing Scrumban usually retain key scrum artifacts and characteristics such as role definitions, time boxes, daily standups, rhythmic releases, retrospectives, and others.  It's how these things come to work together that typically ends up varying across adaptations.  And this reality is what allows us to take a Scrum-specific tool and build in the necessary adaptability for Scrumban. 

So Scrumban is not about using elements of both Scrum and Kanban to create a software development process.  It’s about applying the Kanban Method as a catalyst for evolutionary change to an existing Scrum software development process, optimizing Scrum’s natural tendencies toward agility and continuous improvement.  And that's ultimately what we're here to support.


###Why does Scrumban matter?###  

Scrum is a great agile software development framework.  Kanban is a great framework for managing knowledge work.  When you layer these frameworks together, the whole is far greater than the sum of its parts.  This is because the combined frameworks: 

1. more effectively manage the inherent variability of knowledge work like software development
  
2. further improve upon predictability and sustainability (by better balancing real demands against real capabilities based on empirical data from actual performance)

3. have no prescribed process destination (incremental evolution is encouraged over the life of the system based on the needs of the system, and not some arbitrary yardstick of “maturity”)

4. provide more natural and contagious mechanisms for scaling improvements across an enterprise (effectively implementing Scrum across the enterprise often requires radical change driven by a top-down effort.  Scrumban can germinate anywhere within an organization and naturally spreads quickly)

5. place a greater focus on waste elimination and incorporate more product / organization management features into the mix such as risk, value & cost.


Over the next several days we'll be publishing more articles that speak to these factors and why you may want to start considering Scrumban for your own organization.  Whether you choose to do so or not, however, you can be confident ScrumDo will continue to ease your management and collaboration along the way.
