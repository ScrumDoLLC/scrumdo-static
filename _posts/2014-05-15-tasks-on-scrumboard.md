title: Tasks on your Scrum Board
---

Today, we've released a new way to view your Scrum Board by seeing the tasks as well as the stories.  
To use it, first select the gear icon on your scrum board to open the config window, and select the
"Task Board" option.

After doing this, you will notice that your "Doing" column is a lot wider than it used to be.

Any story you move into that Doing column will have a full sub-table of all the
tasks within it that you can drag into columns and visually track the progress.
The columns that appear will be the task statuses you set up in your Project Admin
page.

Since we released our original Scrum Board way back in 2011 we've had a small but steady stream of 
people asking to view their tasks on the board in addition to their stories.  Due to some unfortunate 
early design decisions, that was hard for us to do and other priorities always kept us from developing it.
A flash of insight hit us last month on a simpler way to implement this feature.  That combined
with a rather scathing rant from a customer last week (you know who you are!) kicked us in-gear 
to implement this.

We have some future plans to improve this feature including bringing this functionality to our 
continuous flow boards, and making this option available in the custom configuration of scrum boards.
But for now, we wanted to get this version released to all of our users.
