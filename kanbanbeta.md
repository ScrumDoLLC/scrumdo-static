# ScrumDo Kanban Project Beta Program

Hello!  Thank you for signing up to help us get our new Kanban projects just right.  This page has some information to help you get started.

## Your feedback is critical!

The whole reason we're giving a few companies early access is to get your feedback and make this new feature useful.  Please, consider dropping us an email **every day or two** letting us know how it went.  Let us know what you like, or what you didn't like.  Even just a simple note along the lines of "Used it a bunch today, everything looking ok." is helpful so we can judge how much exposure it's getting.

Please send those comments to [support@scrumdo.com](mailto:support@scrumdo.com) and put Kanban Beta in the subject so we can make sure the right people look at them.

## Creating a Kanban project

There are two ways you can start.  The first, is by simply creating a new project and selecting Kanban as the project type.

The second method is by going to an existing scrum project, selecting the project admin page, and using the Kanbanize wizard to duplicate your project in Kanban mode (the original project isn't changed so it's safe to do).  Let us know if you use this method, we're trying to pay close attention to make sure that it works right with everyone's projects.

If you don't see these option, it means we haven't enabled the Kanban access on your organization.  Let us know and we'll fix that.

## Need some help?

We have a few help pages written up which you can access [from here](http://content.scrumdo.com/help/) (The help pages are a little bare since they're being written during this period)

There is also [a video we recorded](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JCKz9lSCqjk) that shows some of the basics of creating your Kanban board.  

And of course, you can email [support@scrumdo.com](mailto:support@scrumdo.com) with questions (please remember the Kanban Beta in the subject).

## Need some help with Kanban in general?

We like [this book](http://www.amazon.com/Kanban-Successful-Evolutionary-Technology-Business/dp/0984521402/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1386339589&sr=8-1&keywords=kanban) by David J. Anderson.

We've also partenered with Code Genesys to offer accredited Kanban training courses.  You can send them an email [ajay@codegenesys.com](mailto:ajay@codegenesys.com) to find out more.
