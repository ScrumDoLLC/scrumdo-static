## What is a personal project or a personal board?

A personal project or a 'personal kanban board' is a way for members of an organization to track things that only they care about.  They are only viewable by the creator of the project/board.  These are great for things like:

* Tracking your personal work
  * Honey-Do lists
  * Personal career goals
  * To-read lists
  * Personal ideations

* Product Owner Pre-planning:
  * Pre-planning may be done and then stories promoted to team board backlogs

* Tracking confidential information that other employees shouldn't see, such as:
  * Track employee performance
  * Confidential contract status
  * Financial and budget process approvals


You can create either a timebox(iteration/sprint) based or a flow(iterationless/sprint less) based personal project.  
Account owners or Staff members of your organization can see that the project exists, but can not see the content of your personal project/board.


Some differences of personal projects:

* Third party extras are not available for personal projects.
* Newsfeed and activity emails are not generated for personal projects.
* Personal projects can not be part of a release.


Please note, personal projects do count against your organization's subscription limit.


## How to create a personal project.

Select the Projects option from your organization's drop down menu in the top navbar.  If personal projects
are enabled for your organization, you'll see a button in the lower right hand corner labeled "New personal Project".


## Disabling personal projects

A staff member of your organization can enable or disable personal projects by going
to the organization menu in the top navbar, selecting "Organization Admin", and
turning the option off on the resulting page.
