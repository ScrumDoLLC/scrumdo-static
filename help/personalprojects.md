## What is a personal project?

A personal project is a way for members of an organization to track things that only they care about.  They are only viewable by the creator of the project.  These are great for things like:

* Tracking your personal work
* Tracking confidential information that other employees shouldn't see, such as:
  * Track employee performance
  * Confidential contract status

You can create either a Scrum or a Kanban based personal project.  

Staff members of your organization can see that the project exists, but can not see the content of the project.

Some differences of personal projects:

* Third party extras are not available for personal projects.
* Newsfeed and activity emails are not generated for personal projects.
* Personal projects can not be part of a release.

Please note, personal projects do count against your organization's subscription limit.

Note: The name of the project, and the fact that it exists is visible to organization staff members.

## How to create a personal project.

Select the Projects option from your organization's drop down menu in the top navbar.  If personal projects
are enabled for your organization, you'll see a button in the lower right hand corner labeled "New personal Project".


## Disabling personal projects

A staff member of your organization can enable or disable personal projects by going
to the organization menu in the top navbar, selecting "Organization Admin", and
turning the option off on the resulting page.
