# Personal Kanban- Get more out of your time and do things you really care about

Personal Kanban is a very simple and effective way of planning and managing life, family, school or work. It helps bring order in your life for you to increase and track your personal productivity. It is simple to learn, use and is super easy to adapt.

## Tell me more..

Very simply a user would create a 'personal kanban board' to visualize, organize, analyze and manage their personal stuff.  It may relate to work or life to track things that only they care about.  They are only viewable by the creator of the project/board.  These are great for things like:


### Individual and families tracking your personal work
- Honey-Do lists
- Personal career goals
- To-read lists
- Personal ideations

### Tracking school work
- Home work
- Special project work

### Personal training routine
- Work out schedule
- Training goals

### Product Owner Pre-planning
- Pre-planning may be done and then stories promoted to team board backlogs


### Tracking confidential information:
- Track employee performance
- Confidential contract status
- inancial and budget process approvals

### CEO:
- Portfolio Initiative Planning
- Sales tracking
- Budget Planning


You can create either a timebox (iteration/sprint) based or a flow (iterationless/sprint less) based personal project.  
Account owners or Staff members of your organization can see that the project exists, but can not see the content of your personal project/board.


Some differences of personal projects:

* Third party extras are not available for personal projects.
* Newsfeed and activity emails are not generated for personal projects.
* Personal projects can not be part of a release.


Please note, personal projects do count against your organization's subscription limit.


## How to create a personal project board.

1. Select the Projects option from your organization's ( a home can be an organization of course) drop down menu in the top navbar.  If personal projects are enabled for your organization, you'll see a button in the lower right hand corner labeled "New personal Project".

2. You can chose a project to be personal iteration based project or a personal kanban board. We recommend the latter because of it's flexibility.

3. You can coose a template or start from scratch. We recommend choosing one of the templates which is a personal kanban board template and then customizing it by renaming/adding/deleting as your work flow dictates. 

4. As you customize your work flow- don't forget to set the WIP limits for your swimlanes and or columns.

5. That's it! Go ahead and share it with your friends and family.



## Disabling personal projects

A staff member of your organization can enable or disable personal projects by going
to the organization menu in the top navbar, selecting "Organization Admin", and
turning the option off on the resulting page.
