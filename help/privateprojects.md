## What is a private project?

A private project is only viewable by the creator of the project.  These are great for things like:

* Tracking confidential information that other employees shouldn't see
  * Track employee performance
  * Confidential contract status
* Tracking your personal work

You can create either a Scrum or a Kanban based private project.  

Staff members of your organization can see that the project exists, but can not see the content of the project.

Some differences of private projects:

* Third party extras are not available for private projects.
* Newsfeed and activity emails are not generated for private projects.

Please note, private projects do count against your organization's subscription limit.

## How to create a private project.

Select the Projects option from your organization's drop down menu in the top navbar.  If private projects
are enabled for your organization, you'll see a button in the upper right hand corner labeled "New Private Project".


## Disabling private projects

A staff member of your organization can enable or disable private projects by going
to the organization menu in the top navbar, selecting "Organization Admin", and
turning the option off on the resulting page.
