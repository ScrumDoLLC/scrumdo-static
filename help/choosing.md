title: Time boxed or Continuous flow?
---

### Introduction

 Choosing whether to create a "Time boxed" based or a "Continuous flow" based project is one of your first decisions points, when you create a project in ScrumDo. 

A time box is an Iteration or a Sprint in ScrumDo. If you are doing traditional Scrum then "Time boxed" projects should be the right fit for you. 

Generally speaking, "Time boxed" projects work best when you want to have a fixed cadence of time in which you want to deliver work regularly. Work is more or less defined by a product owner and accepted & delivered by a mature team.

Again generalizing, "Continuous flow" projects work best when you have less defined pieces of work to be done.

This page aims to help you understand some of the differences between "Time boxed" and "Continuous flow" projects in ScrumDo. 

Scrumban allows project administrators to seamlessly convert an "Time boxed" project to "Continuous flow".  Presently, however, the reverse is not true.  Once a "Continuous flow" framework has been selected for a project, you won't be able to return to a "Time boxed" project (yet...  future releases will include this capability).
